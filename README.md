## Project Overview

Site suitability analysis is a process used to determine the appropriateness of a given area for a particular use. This project utilizes GIS techniques to evaluate and rank locations based on specific criteria, facilitating informed decision-making for urban planning, environmental management, and other applications.

## Dataset

The analysis employs spatial datasets, including land use, proximity to roads, water bodies, and other relevant factors. Due to data sharing restrictions, the specific datasets used in this project are not included in the repository. Users can apply their own datasets following the structure outlined in the notebook.

## Installation

To run the analysis, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.8 or higher

* Jupyter Notebook
* pandas
* geopandas
* matplotlib
* rasterio
* fiona
* shapely

Install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas geopandas matplotlib rasterio fiona shapely
```

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ajiwunmi/site_suitability_analysis.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd site_suitability_analysis
   ```
3. **Open the Jupyter Notebook:**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook site_suitability_analysis.ipynb
   ```
4. **Run the notebook cells:**
   Follow the instructions within the notebook to load your data, perform the analysis, and visualize the results.

## Methodology

The analysis involves the following steps:

1. **Data Collection:** Gather spatial data relevant to the suitability criteria.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and prepare the data for analysis, including handling missing values and ensuring coordinate reference systems are consistent.
3. **Criteria Definition:** Define the factors influencing suitability, such as proximity to infrastructure, land use types, and environmental constraints.
4. **Weight Assignment:** Assign weights to each criterion based on their relative importance.
5. **Overlay Analysis:** Combine the weighted criteria layers to produce a suitability map.
6. **Result Interpretation:** Analyze the output map to identify optimal sites.
